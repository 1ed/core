Feature: Relations support
  In order to use a hypermedia API
  As a client software developer
  I need to be able to update relations between resources

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Create a related dummy
    Given I send a "POST" request to "/related_dummies" with body:
    """
    {}
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json"
    And the JSON should be equal to:

      "@id": "/related_dummies/1",
      "@type": "RelatedDummy"
